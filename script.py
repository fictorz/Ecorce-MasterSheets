    Mediates complaints between two users, simulates mediation, and uses Gemini 2.0 Flash
    to redact a contract based on the complaints and (simulated) mediation.

    **Requires:**
    - `google-generativeai` library installed: `pip install google-generativeai`
    - A Gemini API key configured (see instructions below).

    **To get a Gemini API key:**
    1. Go to [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and get an API key.
    2. You can set it as an environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or directly in the script (less secure, but for testing).

    **Note:** This script provides a basic integration with Gemini 2.0 Flash for contract redaction.
    For more sophisticated redaction, you might need to refine the prompts and potentially use a more powerful Gemini model.
    Real-world contract redaction may also require legal review.
